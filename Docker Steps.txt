Docker Steps:
1] define virtualization with example nd also know virtualization types nd advantages nd disadvantages
2] hypervisor nd its types
3] difference btwn containerization and virtualization

steps:
step-1] open windows powershell
step-2] thn type the commands as follows...

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

To create container commands are as follows...........
Execute a command in a running container
PS C:\Users\AFIYA> docker exec -it 69515f6509d5 /bin/bash
Error response from daemon: container 69515f6509d5cd8536da3347a38d4c2e5f8694e8c4a06eb5c77cb06f64c4e600 is not running
PS C:\Users\AFIYA> docker exec -it 358d255d6059 /bin/bash
root@358d255d6059:/# echo "hello"
hello
root@358d255d6059:/# exit
